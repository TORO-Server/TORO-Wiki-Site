### What is TORO Server?

**TORO Server is a 24-hour, creative-focused Japanese Minecraft server that has been in operation since 2017!**  
Our key feature is freedom! You can create anything you want as long as it adheres to the rules.  
You can also use TORO Server as an alternative to a single-player creative world.  
**Additionally, you can apply to use WorldEdit, a powerful tool to assist with your constructions, via Discord or other designated methods!**

### What to do if your building is grieved?

If your building has been vandalized or modified without your permission, you can check the logs. Run the command /co i, then click on the location of the vandalism or modification. This will show you the time and the offending user's log.  
(You can disable log check mode by executing /co i again.)  
Once confirmed, submit a screenshot of the location and its logs, along with the offending user's ID, to the official Discord server's dedicated vandalism reporting thread (#荒らし通報). After submitting the report, a rollback or other corrective action will be taken by the management team.  
If you are unable to use Discord, please report the vandalism in the Minecraft server chat to an Administrator or a supporter (a user with a prefix of [Sup], [Mod], [Admin], or [Owner]).  
  
**Please do not make noise, fight back against the perpetrator, or otherwise provoke them. Doing so may result in punishment for yourself.**

### Official Discord

TORO Server has an official Discord server.  
Please note: We do not allow anyone under the age of 13 to join our Discord server, even with parental consent. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience.
